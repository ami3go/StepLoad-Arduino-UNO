# Arduino StepLoad generator (Dynamic load or Transient Load)
Small and usefull tool on power supply's designer desk for quick check the stability of power supply. 
It provide fast load change form some preload (min load) to working load. 
Doing this an usfull inofmation on feedback loop could be extracted.

Simple software for my custom project of StepLoad pulse generator
It could be used as nice tample for pulse generator board


Main features are: 
- Fenite state machine (GUI/main code)
- Rottary encoder support (click and hold) 
- Command line interface (use onboard USB and serial port)
- Buttons support 
- Leds support 
- Timer One and Timet Two 
Project have various lib, links to original source are provided in code. 
All libs are local to be able clone and compile project. 

TBD: 
Add hardware parts, shematic and gerbers
